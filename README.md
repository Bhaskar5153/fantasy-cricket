# fantasy-cricket

Hello, This is my first GitHub experience. I would like to share a little technique and idea behind creating a predition model for fantasy cricket.
the data is being taken from https://www.espncricinfo.com/

the players have been selected based on their T20 performance record like num of runs, highest score and Strike rate. there are various other factors we can include and make our model to judge the player. but as a sample execution, i have taken these 3 as X features and y for target('selected/not selected).

our goal is to find out the 11 best players out of 22 players in a match.
so we train our model to read the data and understand who fits in the match.
the solution for this being created using logistic regression since our data is linear.
i have used kivy library for application GUI and trainied our app to learn from data and ready to predict if the player can be selected or not.
you can check out the code for execution of project.

please contact me via email (baskar.baskar91@gmail.com) or github for any questions.
