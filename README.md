# fantasy-cricket

Hello, This is my first GitHub experience. I would like to share a little technique and idea behind creating a predition model for fantasy cricket.
the data is being taken from https://www.espncricinfo.com/
i still need to prepare the data for all IPL teams. so far, i believe CSK team has been uploaded with performance record.

the players have been selected based on their T20 performance record. like num of runs, hight score and Strike rate. there various other factors we can include and make our model to judge the player. but as a sample execution, i have taken these 3 as X features and y for target('selected/not selected).

our goal is to find out the 11 best players out of 22 players in a match.
so we train our model to read the data and understand who fits in the match.
so far, i have only created the solution. i currently working on training the numarical data for model so that it can make real world predictions. however, i cannot be certain if my training code is correct. 

please contact me via email (baskar.baskar91@gmail.com) or github if anyone interested to take part of the project.
